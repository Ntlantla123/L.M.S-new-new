 <h2>AWS Security Credentials</h2>
      <br>

<p>Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals,
    companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide 
  distributed computingprocessing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms.</p>
               
 
<p>When you interact with AWS, you specify your AWS security credentials to verify who you are and
  whether you have permission to access the resources that you are requesting. AWS uses the security
  credentials to authenticate and authorize your requests.
  For example, if you want to download a protected file from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
  S3) bucket, your credentials must allow that access.If your credentials aren't authorized to download the
  file, AWS denies your request. However, your AWS security credentials are not required to download a file
  in an Amazon S3 bucket that is publicly shared.</p> 

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>AWS account root user credentials and IAM usercredentials</h2>

  <p>There are two different types of users in AWS. You are either the account owner (root user) or you are
    an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user. The root user is created when the AWS account
    is created and IAM users are created by the root user or an IAM administrator for the account. All AWS
    users have security credentials.</p>
  
                
        
     <br>

    
         <h1>Duration</h1>
<p>According to Amazon Web Services, the Foundational AWS certificate takesabout three to six months of study of AWS Cloud and
  IT industry concepts to pass the exam.Associate level AWS certificates may 
   a year of hands-on experience and study to qualify for compute:Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.</p>

<br>
<h2>AWS Cloud Products</h2>
<p>Storage: Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and
   operates data storage as a service. It's delivered on demand with just-in-time capacity and costs, and eliminates buying and managing 

   your own data storage infrastructure. This gives you agility, global scale and durability, with “anytime, anywhere” data access.</P>
