  <h2>Module 4</h2>

<p>This software testing QA training course is designed by working professionals in a way that,
 course it will progress from introducing you to the basics of software testing to advanced topics
 like Software configuration management, creating a test plan, test estimations etc.</p>

<p>Software testing is the act of examining the artifacts and the behavior of the software under test by validation and verification.</p>
   <p>Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand 
   the risks of software implementation.</p>
  <p>Test techniques include, but not necessarily limited to:
     analyzing the product requirements for completeness and correctness in various contexts like industry perspective,
     business perspective, feasibility and viability of implementation, usability, performance, security, infrastructure considerations, etc.</p>
   <p> reviewing the product architecture and the overall design of the product
     working with product developers on improvement in coding techniques, design patterns,
     that can be written as part of code based on various techniques like boundary conditions, etc.</p>
     <p>executing a program or application with the intent of examining behavior
     reviewing the deployment infrastructure and associated scripts & automation
    take part in production activities by using monitoring & observability techniques</p>
    <p>Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of
       software and risk of its failure to users or sponsors</p>
